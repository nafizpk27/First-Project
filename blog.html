            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science
            that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks
            that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include
            problem-solving, decision-making, language understanding, and
            visual perception. AI technology leverages algorithms, machine
            learning, and neural networks to analyze data, recognize patterns,
            and make predictions. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa
            to advanced robotics and self-driving cars, AI is increasingly 
            integrated into our daily lives, transforming industries and 
            enhancing productivity. Despite its rapid advancement, AI also
            presents challenges related to ethical considerations, job 
            displacement, 
            and the need for regulation to ensure its beneficial and fair use

        <p style="font-size: 120%;">The future of AI technology promises transformative advancements across various sectors.
            As AI continues to evolve, we can expect more sophisticated and autonomous systems
            capable of performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention. Innovations
            in machine learning, natural language processing, and neural networks will drive
            AI's ability to understand and interact with humans more naturally. 
            AI will revolutionize industries such as healthcare, finance, 
            transportation, and education by enhancing efficiency, personalization,
            and decision-making processes. However, the rapid growth of AI also
            raises ethical and societal concerns, necessitating the development
            of robust frameworks for governance, transparency, and
            accountability to ensure the responsible deployment of AI technologies
